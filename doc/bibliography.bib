On July 2, 2015, Jason Baumgartner published a dataset advertised to include ``every publicly available Reddit comment'' which was quickly shared on Bittorrent and the Internet Archive. This data quickly became the basis of many academic papers on topics including machine learning, social behavior, politics, breaking news, and hate speech. We have discovered substantial gaps and limitations in this dataset which may contribute to bias in the findings of that research. In this paper, we document the dataset, substantial missing observations in the dataset, and the risks to research validity from those gaps. In summary, we identify strong risks to research that considers user histories or network analysis, moderate risks to research that compares counts of participation, and lesser risk to machine learning research that avoids making representative claims about behavior and participation on Reddit.},

  abstract    = {When large social-media platforms allow users to easily form and self-organize into interest groups, highly related communities can arise. For example, the Reddit site hosts not just a group called food, but also HealthyFood, foodhacks, foodporn, and cooking, among others. Are these highly related communities created for similar classes of reasons (e.g., to focus on a subtopic, to create a place for allegedly more "high-minded" discourse, etc.)? How do users allocate attention between such close alternatives when they are available or emerge over time? Are there different types of relations between close alternatives such as sharing many users vs. a new community drawing away members of an older one vs. a splinter group failing to cohere into a viable separate community? We investigate the interactions between highly related communities using data from reddit.com consisting of 975M posts and comments spanning an 8-year period. We identify a set of typical affixes that users adopt to create highly related communities and build a taxonomy of affixes. One interesting finding regarding users' behavior is: after a newer community is created, for several types of highly-related community pairs, users that engage in a newer community tend to be more active in their original community than users that do not explore, even when controlling for previous level of engagement.},

Aggregate Markov models are class-based bigram models in which the mapping from words to classes is probabilistic. Mixed-order Markov models combine bigram models whose predictions are conditioned on different words. Both types of models are trained by Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. We examine smoothing procedures in which these models are interposed between different order n-grams. This is found to significantly reduce the perplexity of unseen word combinations.},

  abstract    = {Although analyzing user behavior within individual communities is an active and rich research domain, people usually interact with multiple communities both on- and off-line. How do users act in such multi-community environments? Although there are a host of intriguing aspects to this question, it has received much less attention in the research community in comparison to the intra-community case. In this paper, we examine three aspects of multi-community engagement: the sequence of communities that users post to, the language that users employ in those communities, and the feedback that users receive, using longitudinal posting behavior on Reddit as our main data source, and DBLP for auxiliary experiments. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of features drawn from these aspects in predicting users' future level of activity. One might expect that a user's trajectory mimics the "settling-down" process in real life: an initial exploration of sub-communities before settling down into a few niches. However, we find that the users in our data continually post in new communities; moreover, as time goes on, they post increasingly evenly among a more diverse set of smaller communities. Interestingly, it seems that users that eventually leave the community are "destined" to do so from the very beginning, in the sense of showing significantly different "wandering" patterns very early on in their trajectories; this finding has potentially important design implications for community maintainers. Our multi-community perspective also allows us to investigate the "situation vs. personality" debate from language usage across different communities.},

  abstract  = {Unter einem egozentrierten Netzwerk versteht man die Beziehungen einer fokalen Person (Ego) zu anderen Personen (Alteri), mit denen sie in einem direkten Kontakt steht. Statt von einem egozentrierten Netzwerk wird manchmal auch von einem persönlichen Netzwerk gesprochen. Die notwendigen Angaben stammen meist von Ego; d. h. die fokale Person gibt Auskunft über ihre Beziehungen zu anderen Personen, über die Beziehungen zwischen diesen Anderen sowie über deren Eigenschaften. Während die Analyse sozialer (Gesamt-) Netzwerke typischerweise auf verhältnismäßig kleine Gruppen beschränkt ist, eröffnet das Konzept des egozentrierten Netzwerkes die Möglichkeit, Aussagen über die soziale Einbettung einer großen Anzahl von Personen zu machen. Auf diese Weise werden die Vorzüge von Zufallsstichproben mit denen der Beziehungs- und Netzwerkanalyse verknüpft.},
